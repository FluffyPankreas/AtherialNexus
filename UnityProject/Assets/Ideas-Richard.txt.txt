ENEMIES IDEAS:





GAME MODE/IDEAS: (each is basically a new take on the ARPG/3d Boomer shooter/Roguelike)

1. Have areas in the map. Each area is spawning different enemies. The grey wastes, the Hub etc. Each enemey drops 1 of 3 resources. Farm resources then go back to the hub to "craft" upgrades. Resources could be Energy, Metal and Flux for example.
Build up your character the way you want. In the Hub is a safe area. Upgrade and then when ready teleport to a new harder area.
Endgame?

2.





POWER UP/RUNES:

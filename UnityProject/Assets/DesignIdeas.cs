    /*
     * 01) There needs to be a quiet phase of building and researching.
     * 02) The game should play more like an ARPG than a typical shooter.
     *      a) Enemies should have some predictable behaviours.
     *      b) Guns should somehow represent abilities more than just a weapon.
     * 03) Movement should play a major factor in the game, being able to quickly go different places.
     * 04) Have 2 guns on the player, but have multiple guns they can choose from...essentially setup loadouts.
     * 05) Weapon themes are steam punk or diesel punk.
     * 06) Flame thrower weapon
     * 07) Grenade launcher weapon
     * 08) Elephant gun(shotgun)
     * 09) Player character can upgrade stuff like movement speed and jump height.
     * 10) Player can increase their health.
     * 11) The player will keep grabbing stuff, killing auto gives some things...but pickups will also be a thing.
     * 12) Experience??? I don't like the idea...but maybe.
     * 13) Laser style gun with overheating mechanics.
     * 14) Powerful six shooter.
     * 15) Ammo management? 
     * 16) Going with the Limbo idea, the player needs to be able to prep for the next round, so while the exact level won't be known we should show the next "reality" or something that they'll enter. Or the player should be able to choose the reality they want to go to.
     * 17) Poison gun(good as a weapon to kill bosses),
     *      a) Fires blobs that turn into poison clouds that deals damage over time(to the player as well)
     *      b) Fires darts that stack damage as you apply more darts.
     * 18) Running/Jumping uses stamina.
     * 19) Block/Parrying as a mechanic.
     * 20) Are we going to roll stats for monsters or keep them all exactly the same?

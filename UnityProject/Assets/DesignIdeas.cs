    /*
     * 01) There needs to be a quiet phase of building and researching.
     * 02) The game should play more like an ARPG than a typical shooter.
     *      a) Enemies should have some predictable behaviours.
     *      b) Guns should somehow represent abilities more than just a weapon.
     * 03) Movement should play a major factor in the game, being able to quickly go different places.
     * 04) Have 2 guns on the player, but have multiple guns they can choose from...essentially setup loadouts.
     * 05) Weapon themes are steam punk or diesel punk.
     * 06) Flame thrower weapon
     * 07) Grenade launcher weapon
     * 08) Elephant gun(shotgun)
     * 09) Player character can upgrade stuff like movement speed and jump height.
     * 10) Player can increase their health.
     * 11) The player will keep grabbing stuff, killing auto gives some things...but pickups will also be a thing.
     * 12) Experience??? I don't like the idea...but maybe.
     * 13) Laser style gun with overheating mechanics.
     * 14) Powerful six shooter.
     * 15) Ammo management?

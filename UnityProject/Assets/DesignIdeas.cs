     * 1) There needs to be a quiet phase of building and researching.
     * 2) The game should play more like an ARPG than a typical shooter.
     *      a) Enemies should have some predictable behaviours.
     *      b) Guns should somehow represent abilities more than just a weapon.
     * 3) Movement should play a major factor in the game, being able to quickly go different places.

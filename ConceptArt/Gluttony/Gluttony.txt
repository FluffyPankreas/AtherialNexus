a dark, foreboding dimension representing the sin of Gluttony for a level in a first-person shooter game. The environment should be grotesque and oppressive, with towering piles of decaying food, rotting meat, and overflowing barrels of foul liquids scattered throughout the landscape. The ground is sticky and uneven, composed of a mix of congealed fat, spilled wine, and broken bones. Massive, grotesque statues of obese, monstrous figures loom in the distance, with hollow eyes and gaping mouths, eternally consuming. The sky is a sickly, greenish hue, with clouds swirling like thick smoke. Rivers of thick, bubbling sludge flow through the area, emitting noxious fumes. Giant, decayed feasts are set on tables, where malformed creatures gorge themselves endlessly, oblivious to the decay around them. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of excess, decay, and horror, with muted colors and disturbing textures to enhance the seriousness of the theme

Liquid, bile, sick clouds, grotesque overweight statues, bone geometry, rotting food, corrupt water flowing
